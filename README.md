Actually, you shouldn't spit on it. The friction created from the lack of a lubricant is really important for the male orgasm. You should rub with no lubricant initially to get the penis fully erect, and only after you do that can you lubricate and use your mouth. It's really important you do this to achieve a healthy orgasm.
